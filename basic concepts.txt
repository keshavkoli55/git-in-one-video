There are four stages in git 
1 -: untracked
2 -: stagged 
3 -: modified
4 -: unmodified
we can check the files by using git status (command)
*if some files is present then ,we will first add these file by using git add (file name) or using . or using -A (command) ,by adding these files moved to stagged area , then we will use git commit -m"(any comment you want to use)" or git commit .
if we use git commit ,a editor mode will open after this you will press i button and starts inserting the comment
#TO CLOSE THIS EDITOR WINDOW FIRST ESC -> : -> wq
$ Touch command use to create file in the folder.
* git checkout command is used  to match your present file(modified) to previous committed file and restore previous commit.
#git checkout -f is used for all files present in the folder 
* git log command will show all the committed statments with time and author 
TO FILTER GIT LOG
#git log -p -number (as many as you required)
#q is used to return in main menu
$ git diff will compare the working directory file to stagging area (file is same in both cases)
* git diff (command)
#TO SKIP STAGGING AREA 
use git commit -a -m"any comment"
$git rm (command) is used to delete the file 
*git rm FileName 
OR
*git rm --cached FileName is used to directly remove file from stagging area to untracked file
